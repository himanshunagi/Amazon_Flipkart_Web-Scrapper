# Amazon_Flipkart_Web-Scrapper

I created a Python program and an Excel spreadsheet to scrape data from Amazon and Flipkart. In the Python code, I have implemented a functionality where you can specify an expected price for a product. If the product goes on sale and the price drops below your expected price, you will receive a notification. On the other hand, in the Excel spreadsheet, I have used VBA code to extract data from Amazon and Flipkart based on the product keywords you provide, allowing you to compare prices and decide where to make the purchase.

# Amazon Web Scrapping:
I have written a Python program that performs web scraping using libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests.
The program allows you to specify an expected price for a product.
It scrapes data from Amazon and Flipkart to retrieve the current price of the product.
If the price is below your expected price, the program sends a notification.

# Excel Spreadsheet:
I have used VBA code in the Excel spreadsheet to automate the data extraction process.
You input the product name or keyword in a column, and the VBA code extracts the data from Amazon and Flipkart based on the provided keyword.
The extracted data includes information such as product name, price, and other relevant details.
This allows you to compare prices and make an informed decision on where to purchase the product.
